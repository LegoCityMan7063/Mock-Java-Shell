What did I work on in the last three days?
    - worked on JShell and basis of command class
    - Helped brainstorm ideas and create crcCards for majority of classes

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - finish JShell, and command and exit class
    - work on new tasks for sprint 2

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need inputParser, Output, and errorHandling completed (or at least prototyped) before I can continue working
