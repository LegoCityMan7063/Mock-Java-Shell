hat did I work on in the last three days?
    - Debugged methods in entity classes
    - Manually tested entity classes, making sure methods are behaving as wanted

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Work on commands mkdir, pwd, and history
    - See if there are needs to update entity classes as develop

Am I blocked on anything?
    -
