hat did I work on in the last three days?
    - Working on search algorithm in Path, as to create the ability to search for specific path

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Rewrite search path algorithm to be more readable
    - With the search algorithm perfected, I will then work on mkdir to make it more versatile

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Currently coming up with an iterative method of searching, may require time
